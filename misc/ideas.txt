Game type: RTS
Based in: Apocolyses (Zombie Apocolypse)

Game Details:
* Defend against other players + zombies (AI)
* Goal - raid the enemies base, get all resources, be last one standing
* Raiding does not give direct points in itself, but will allow you to take other's stores (limited on-man storage), others will MOST LIKELY die out/be eliminated.
* Base creates army, also reproduction heirarchy - "Hero" creates "Commanders", "Commanders" create "Minions".
* Start with 1 "Hero" and 1 "Commander"
* All created characters spawn at base, need at least one of the other types to be able to crate them.
* "Minions" have different types - builders/fighters/gatherers
* Gatherers can't gather without an active base.
* Lower ranks have lower health/on-man storage.
* Zombies have a chance to take over bodies of victims, and chance grows as game goes on.

Random Unused Ideas - thought up by my tired, randomness-filled brain:
* NEED GUNZ - LOTS OF GUNZ
* TANKS
* MACHETTES
* ANYTHING GOES
* GIANT PURPLE SAINTS ROW 3 DILDO WIELDED BY HUGE FAT LADYMAN
* ZOMBIE ELEPHANTS - WAY MOAR AGGRESSIVE AND WANNA JUST FUCKING KILL YOU
